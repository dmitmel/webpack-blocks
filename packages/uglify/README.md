This block provides UglifyJS webpack plugin configuration for [webpack-blocks](https://github.com/andywer/webpack-blocks).

Based on [uglifyjs-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin) (not `webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin`) which uses UglifyJS v3 (uglify-es) that supports ECMAScript 2015.


## Usage

```js
const { createConfig, env, uglify } = require('webpack-blocks')

module.exports = createConfig([
  env('production', [
    uglify(/* options */)
  ])
])
```

## Options

You can pass any `uglifyjs-webpack-plugin` and UglifyJS options, see the [uglifyjs-webpack-plugin docs for details](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin#options).

## Generated webpack config

By default generates this configuration:

```js
{
  plugins: [
    new UglifyJSPlugin({
      parallel: true,
      cache: true,
      uglifyOptions: {
        compress: {
          warnings: false
        }
      }
    })
  ]
}
```
