# How to Contribute

## Setup

Fork and clone this repository, then run

```bash
npm install
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## Code

This repository is a monorepo which means that it contains multiple npm packages.

Running `npm install` in the repository's root directory will install the dependencies of all packages and link the packages that depend on each other.

Running `npm test` in the repository's root directory will run all packages' tests. Run `npm test` in a package to test this package only.

Just edit the code like you always do. Be aware that we automatically format the code using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

When adding a new package you might need to run `npm run postinstall` in the repository's root directory to update the links between packages depending on each other.
